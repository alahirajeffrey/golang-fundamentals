## Golang Fundamentals

I recently started reading a book by Thorsten Ball titled "Writng an Interpreter in Go". I tried following the book and coding along, however it was proved particularly difficult as I had not really written go before. I decided to take a few days and take a crash course on go making use of youtube videos, online articles and chatgpt along the way

This repo contains all the code I wrote along the way

I would probably continue to update it as I play along with go.
